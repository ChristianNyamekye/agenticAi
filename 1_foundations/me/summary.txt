My name is Christian Nyamekye. I’m a software engineer, entrepreneur, and maker. I grew up in Ghana and now study Computer Science at Dartmouth, where I’ve been building projects that merge accessibility, AI, and design. 
I love anime and engineering quirks—often seeing connections between the two—and I’m always tinkering with side projects, whether it’s building assistive tech like GARB or experimenting with new startup ideas. 
I also have a soft spot for exploring food markets (Stanley Market in Hong Kong was a favorite), though I’m still working on acquiring a taste for overly spicy food.
